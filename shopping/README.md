# ShoppingApp
> Responsive eCommerce website implemented with React, Typescript, Sass, Material UI and Redux, created with Mobile-first approach.
> Live demo [_here_](https://MichalWalczak777.github.io/ShoppingApp/).

## General Information
- Shopping App is an eCommerce website for buying clothes,
- project made from scratch, not by following a tutorial,
- designed by me on different screen versions with Mobile-first approach,
- I decided to implement an eCommerce project as it is one of the most common types of websites; it also seemed to be a good opportunity to use  Redux state management,
- I used Material UI to achieve a modern look and better UX standards

## Technologies Used
- React - version 17.0.
- Redux - version 4.0.
- TypeScript - version 4.1.
- Sass
- Material UI - version 4.0

## Features
- Landing page with sections linking to product categories: Woman, Man, Kid
- List of products page; items displayed with "load more" button, filtered by gender and clothing category (T-shirt, Sweater, etc.)
- Clothing category search
- Product details page
- Login/registration - User authentication with Firebase
- Adding and removing items from shopping basket - state management with Redux, data saved in local storage

## Setup
Node.js version between 12-15 needs to be installed. Versions can be easily installed and switched using Node Version Manager (NVM). 

Use `npm i` command in terminal to install dependencies. Type `npm start` in it to run the project on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Room for Improvement
- create backend authentication and user data storage (basket state etc.),
- create backend service for the list of products with filtering,
- create more advanced search and filtering.
